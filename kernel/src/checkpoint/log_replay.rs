//! The [`CheckpointLogReplayProcessor`] implements specialized log replay logic for creating
//! checkpoint files. It processes log files in reverse chronological order (newest to oldest)
//! and selects the set of actions to include in a checkpoint for a specific version.
//!
//! ## Actions Included for Checkpointing
//!
//! For checkpoint creation, this processor applies several filtering and deduplication
//! steps to each batch of log actions:
//!
//! 1. **Protocol and Metadata**: Retains exactly one of each - keeping only the latest protocol
//!    and metadata actions.
//! 2. **Txn Actions**: Keeps exactly one `txn` action for each unique app ID, always selecting
//!    the latest one encountered.
//! 3. **File Actions**: Resolves file actions to produce the latest state of the table, keeping
//!    the most recent valid add actions and unexpired remove actions (tombstones) that are newer
//!    than `minimum_file_retention_timestamp`.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! - [`CheckpointVisitor`]: Implements [`RowVisitor`] to examine each action in a batch and
//!   determine if it should be included in the checkpoint. It maintains state for deduplication
//!   across multiple actions in a batch and efficiently handles all filtering rules.
//!
//! - [`CheckpointLogReplayProcessor`]: Implements the [`LogReplayProcessor`] trait and orchestrates
//!   the overall process. For each batch of log actions, it:
//!   1. Creates a visitor with the current deduplication state
//!   2. Applies the visitor to filter actions in the batch
//!   3. Updates counters and state for cross-batch deduplication
//!   4. Produces a [`CheckpointData`] result which includes a selection vector indicating which
//!      actions should be included in the checkpoint file
